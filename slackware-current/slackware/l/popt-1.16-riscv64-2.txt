popt: popt (command line parsing library)
popt:
popt: Popt is a C library for parsing command line parameters. Popt was
popt: heavily influenced by the getopt() and getopt_long() functions, but it
popt: improves on them by allowing more powerful argument expansion. Popt
popt: can parse arbitrary argv[] style arrays and automatically set
popt: variables based on command line arguments. Popt allows command line
popt: arguments to be aliased via configuration files and includes utility
popt: functions for parsing arbitrary strings into argv[] arrays using
popt: shell-like rules.
