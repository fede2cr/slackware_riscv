libxcb: libxcb (X protocol C-language Binding)
libxcb:
libxcb: The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System protocol
libxcb: which is fully capable of replacing Xlib. In fact, libX11 makes use
libxcb: of libxcb as much as possible. :-) Porting to XCB has several
libxcb: advantages such as a smaller memory footprint, latency hiding, direct
libxcb: protocol access, and improved thread support.
