libvdpau: libvdpau (VDPAU wrapper library)
libvdpau:
libvdpau: This package contains the libvdpau wrapper library and the
libvdpau: libvdpau_trace debugging library, along with the header files needed
libvdpau: to build VDPAU applications. To actually use a VDPAU device, you
libvdpau: need a vendor-specific implementation library, like the one
libvdpau: shipped with nvidia's binary graphics driver.
