autofs: autofs (kernel-based automounter)
autofs:
autofs: autofs is a kernel-based automounter for Linux. It performs a job
autofs: similar to amd(8) but relies on a small stub of kernel code instead of
autofs: pretending to be an NFS server. The result is simpler code, better
autofs: reliability, and much faster operation in the common case (everything
autofs: already mounted.)
