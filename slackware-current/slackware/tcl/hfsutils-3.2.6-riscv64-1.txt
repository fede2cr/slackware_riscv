hfsutils:
hfsutils: hfsutils is a collection of tools for reading and writing Macintosh
hfsutils: HFS volumes.  These utilities can manipulate HFS volumes on nearly any
hfsutils: medium.  Since hfs and xhfs are linked with Tcl/Tk shared libraries,
hfsutils: the hfsutils package is included here in the TCL software series.
