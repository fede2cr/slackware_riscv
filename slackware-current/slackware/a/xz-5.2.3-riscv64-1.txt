xz: xz (compression utility based on the LZMA algorithm)
xz:
xz: LZMA is a general purpose compression algorithm designed by Igor
xz: Pavlov as part of 7-Zip.  It provides high compression ratio while
xz: keeping the decompression speed fast.  XZ Utils are an attempt to make
xz: LZMA compression easy to use on free (as in freedom) operating
xz: systems.
