lzip: lzip (a lossless data compressor)
lzip:
lzip: Lzip is a lossless data compressor with a user interface similar to
lzip: the one of gzip or bzip2.  Lzip decompresses almost as fast as gzip
lzip: and compresses more than bzip2, which makes it well suited for
lzip: software distribution and data archiving.  Lzip is a clean
lzip: implementation of the LZMA algorithm.
