elilo: elilo (Linux Loader for EFI-based platforms)
elilo:
elilo: This is elilo, a boot loader originally developed by HP for IA-64
elilo: systems.  This is used to load the kernel and initial ramdisk on
elilo: machines that use UEFI.  Since most UEFI implementations are 64-bit,
elilo: the 64-bit EFI binary is generally the one to use (even for loading
elilo: a 32-bit kernel).
