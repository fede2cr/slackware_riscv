xfsdump: xfsdump (backup tools for the XFS filesystem)
xfsdump:
xfsdump: The xfsdump package contains the xfsdump and xfsrestore utilities for
xfsdump: backing up and restoring XFS partitions.  xfsdump examines files in a
xfsdump: filesystem, determines which need to be backed up, and copies those
xfsdump: files to a specified disk, tape or other storage medium.  xfsrestore
xfsdump: performs the inverse function of xfsdump; it can restore a full
xfsdump: or incremental backup of a filesystem.
