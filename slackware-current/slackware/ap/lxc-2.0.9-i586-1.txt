lxc: lxc (Linux Containers)
lxc:
lxc: Linux Containers (LXC) are an operating system-level virtualization
lxc: method for running multiple isolated server installs (containers) on
lxc: a single control host.  LXC does not provide a virtual machine, but
lxc: rather provides a virtual environment that has its own process and
lxc: network space.  It is similar to a chroot, but offers more isolation.

lxc: Daniel Lezcano is the primary developer of lxc.
