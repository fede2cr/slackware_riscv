  The patch to restore tcp_wrappers no longer works (applies, but breaks
  incoming connections), so tcp_wrappers is no longer supported. This support
  was dropped by upstream years ago, and there are many better ways to filter
  incoming ports since the days when tcp_wrappers was the only choice.
  There is very little chance that we will try to add support for tcp_wrappers
  again here. Migrate to a better port filtering solution (e.g., iptables or
  nftables), or (I suppose) you could try asking for the support to be
  reinstated upstream. ;-)

  This is a security update in order to patch the following defects:
    On a Samba 4 AD DC the LDAP server in all versions of Samba from
  4.0.0 onwards incorrectly validates permissions to modify passwords
  over LDAP allowing authenticated users to change any other users`
  passwords, including administrative users.
    All versions of Samba from 4.0.0 onwards are vulnerable to a denial of
  service attack when the RPC spoolss service is configured to be run as
  an external daemon. Missing input sanitization checks on some of the
  input parameters to spoolss RPC calls could cause the print spooler
  service to crash. There is no known vulnerability associated with this
  error, merely a denial of service. If the RPC spoolss service is left by
  default as an internal service, all a client can do is crash its own
  authenticated connection.

  Let the library stay in /usr/lib{,64}. There's not much point in moving it
  since plzip will require libstdc++.so in /usr/lib{,64}, and we're not going
  to move that one. And realistically, there's also not much point in worrying
  about whether the package tools will work with /usr unavailable.
a/pkgtools-15.0-noarch-4.txz:  Rebuilt.
  makepkg: use find and sed instead of a tar transform. Thanks to Seb.
  installpkg: if a package was not made with makepkg, filter the filelist

  installpkg: support multiple threads for xz. Thanks to ivandi.
  Default threads for plzip is now equal to the number of CPU threads on
  the system rather than the number of physical cores. Default number of
  threads on xz is set to 2, to avoid a memory allocation problem when
  using too many threads on 32-bit. Not that it matters... they still
  haven't implemented multi-threaded xz decompression.
  makepkg: refactored setting compression type by requested extension.

  Use tar-1.30. Thanks to gnashley and ruario for the help.
  Change .tlz to mean .tar.lz. We never really used the previous definition
  (which was tar.lzma), and .lz is a probably a better format than xz or lzma.
  Reference:  https://www.nongnu.org/lzip/xz_inadequate.html
  For xz/lzip based packages, support multithreaded compression/decompression.
  Thanks to Erik Jan Tromp for assistance and advice with testing the changes
  for lzip and thread support, as well for as getting a bug in lzlib/plzip
  fixed upstream.
  Support extended attributes and POSIX ACLs in packages.

  This update fixes a security issue:
  Net::FTP#get, getbinaryfile, gettextfile, put, putbinaryfile, and puttextfile
  use Kernel#open to open a local file. If the localfile argument starts with
  the pipe character "|", the command following the pipe character is executed.
  The default value of localfile is File.basename(remotefile), so malicious FTP
  servers could cause arbitrary command execution.

  These sources have been patched with two patches that have been submitted
  upstream but have yet to appear in the mainline or stable kernels. With the
  patches applied this kernel seems stable now on both 32 and 64-bit x86.
  Thanks to Michele Ballabio for reporting the issue to the upstream kernel
  developers, and to Ming Lei for the fix. Once these patches appear in the
  4.14.x kernel series (and barring any other major regressions), we'll be
  moving these kernels back into the main tree.

We're moving back to the 4.9.x kernel series in the main tree until we can
figure out a fix for unstable 4.14.x kernels (especially on 32-bit). Guessing
it's probably going to be fixable with .config changes, since a greatly
simplified .config is stable. Meanwhile, the latest 4.14.x kernels can now be
found in the testing/ directory.

  Fix heap overflows when parsing malicious files. (CVE-2017-16612)
  It is possible to trigger heap overflows due to an integer overflow
  while parsing images and a signedness issue while parsing comments.
  The integer overflow occurs because the chosen limit 0x10000 for
  dimensions is too large for 32 bit systems, because each pixel takes
  4 bytes. Properly chosen values allow an overflow which in turn will
  lead to less allocated memory than needed for subsequent reads.
  The signedness bug is triggered by reading the length of a comment
  as unsigned int, but casting it to int when calling the function
  XcursorCommentCreate. Turning length into a negative value allows the
  check against XCURSOR_COMMENT_MAX_LEN to pass, and the following
  addition of sizeof (XcursorComment) + 1 makes it possible to allocate
  less memory than needed for subsequent reads.

  Open files with O_NOFOLLOW. (CVE-2017-16611)
  A non-privileged X client can instruct X server running under root
  to open any file by creating own directory with "fonts.dir",
  "fonts.alias" or any font file being a symbolic link to any other
  file in the system. X server will then open it. This can be issue
  with special files such as /dev/watchdog (which could then reboot
  the system).

  This is a security release in order to address the following defects:
  CVE-2017-14746 (Use-after-free vulnerability.)
    All versions of Samba from 4.0.0 onwards are vulnerable to a use after
    free vulnerability, where a malicious SMB1 request can be used to
    control the contents of heap memory via a deallocated heap pointer. It
    is possible this may be used to compromise the SMB server.
  CVE-2017-15275 (Server heap memory information leak.)
    All versions of Samba from 3.6.0 onwards are vulnerable to a heap
    memory information leak, where server allocated heap memory may be
    returned to the client without being cleared.

n/openssl-1.0.2m-i586-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a security issue:
  There is a carry propagating bug in the x64 Montgomery squaring procedure.
  No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA
  and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and
  are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible
  (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce
  information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of
  resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely
  only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would
  additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target
  private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private
  key that is shared between multiple clients.
  This only affects processors that support the BMI1, BMI2 and ADX extensions
  like Intel Broadwell (5th generation) and later or AMD Ryzen.

  This update fixes two security issues:
  Xext/shm: Validate shmseg resource id, otherwise it can belong to a
  non-existing client and abort X server with FatalError "client not
  in use", or overwrite existing segment of another existing client.
  Generating strings for XKB data used a single shared static buffer,
  which offered several opportunities for errors. Use a ring of
  resizable buffers instead, to avoid problems when strings end up
  longer than anticipated.

Good hello! Python 3 has made its entry into -current. :-) Huge thanks are due
to Heinz Wiesinger for a great effort maintaining and testing this on the side
for months now, and for queuing it up for an easy merge without all that many
changes needed, and to Audrius Kažukauskas for maintaining the Python 3
build scripts on slackbuilds.org for years (on which our Python 3 SlackBuild
was based). Enjoy!

n/samba-4.6.8-i586-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This is a security release in order to address the following defects:
  SMB1/2/3 connections may not require signing where they should. A man in the
  middle attack may hijack client connections.
  SMB3 connections don't keep encryption across DFS redirects. A man in the
  middle attack can read and may alter confidential documents transferred via
  a client connection, which are reached via DFS redirect when the original
  connection used SMB3.
  Server memory information leak over SMB1. Client with write access to a share
  can cause server memory contents to be written into a file or printer.

  conversion of X Events.
  Uninitialized data in endianness conversion in the XEvent handling of the
  X.Org X Server allowed authenticated malicious users to access potentially
  privileged data from the X server.

  Fixes security issues:
  A "ssh://..." URL can result in a "ssh" command line with a hostname that
  begins with a dash "-", which would cause the "ssh" command to instead
  (mis)treat it as an option. This is now prevented by forbidding such a
  hostname (which should not impact any real-world usage).
  Similarly, when GIT_PROXY_COMMAND is configured, the command is run with
  host and port that are parsed out from "ssh://..." URL; a poorly written
  GIT_PROXY_COMMAND could be tricked into treating a string that begins with a
  dash "-" as an option. This is now prevented by forbidding such a hostname
  and port number (again, which should not impact any real-world usage).

  Fixes security issues:
  Mercurial's symlink auditing was incomplete prior to 4.3, and could

  Mercurial was not sanitizing hostnames passed to ssh, allowing
  shell injection attacks on clients by specifying a hostname starting
  with -oProxyCommand.

  This update fixes an authentication validation bypass security issue:
  "Orpheus' Lyre mutual authentication validation bypass"
  All versions of Samba from 4.0.0 onwards using embedded Heimdal
  Kerberos are vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack impersonating
  a trusted server, who may gain elevated access to the domain by
  returning malicious replication or authorization data.
  Samba binaries built against MIT Kerberos are not vulnerable.

  This kernel fixes two "Stack Clash" vulnerabilities reported by Qualys.
  The first issue may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with elevated
  privileges. Failed attack attempts will likely result in denial-of-service
  conditions. The second issue can be exploited to bypass certain security
  restrictions and perform unauthorized actions.

  There were some changes made to NTP setup in -current:
  First, NTP drops privileges and runs as ntp:ntp. Be sure to install the
  updated etc package to get the new user and group.
  Some files have been relocated:
  The ntp.keys file has moved from /etc/ntp/ to /etc/.
  The drift and stats files now reside in /var/lib/ntp/.
  The step-tickers file has been removed. It's actually been deprecated for
  a while and nothing has referenced in for quite some time.
  Be sure to move the new rc.ntpd.new into place, and move over or merge
  from the .new config files.
  Thanks to Robby Workman for help with these changes.
  In addition to bug fixes and enhancements, this release fixes security
  issues of medium and low severity:
  Denial of Service via Malformed Config (Medium)
  Authenticated DoS via Malicious Config Option (Medium)
  Potential Overflows in ctl_put() functions (Medium)
  Buffer Overflow in ntpq when fetching reslist from a malicious ntpd (Medium)
  0rigin DoS (Medium)
  Buffer Overflow in DPTS Clock (Low)
  Improper use of snprintf() in mx4200_send() (Low)
  The following issues do not apply to Linux systems:
  Privileged execution of User Library code (WINDOWS PPSAPI ONLY) (Low)
  Stack Buffer Overflow from Command Line (WINDOWS installer ONLY) (Low)
  Data Structure terminated insufficiently (WINDOWS installer ONLY) (Low)

  This update fixes a security issue:
  An incorrect implementation of XEP-0280: Message Carbons in multiple XMPP
  clients allows a remote attacker to impersonate any user, including
  contacts, in the vulnerable application's display.  This allows for various
  kinds of social engineering attacks.

  This update fixes a security issue:
  All versions of Samba prior to 4.6.1, 4.5.7, 4.4.12 are vulnerable to
  a malicious client using a symlink race to allow access to areas of
  the server file system not exported under the share definition.

a/mlocate-0.26-i586-1.txz:  Added.
  This replaces slocate as the system locate/updatedb utilities.
  In tests here, mlocate was about 20% faster than slocate at creating a
  new database.  When updating an existing database, it was many times
  faster.  On my machine, the nightly database update took about 5 minutes
  with slocate, but only a few seconds with mlocate.
  I might miss (slightly) the heavy drive activity at 04:40 that would let
  me know that it was time for bed.  ;-)
  Be sure to move the new /etc/updatedb.conf into place when installing
  this package.

  removing it from the main tree.  If you require json-c for something, it is

  This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability.  An error in handling
  certain queries can cause an assertion failure when a server is using the
  nxdomain-redirect feature to cover a zone for which it is also providing
  authoritative service.  A vulnerable server could be intentionally stopped
  by an attacker if it was using a configuration that met the criteria for
  the vulnerability and if the attacker could cause it to accept a query
  that possessed the required attributes.
  Please note: This vulnerability affects the "nxdomain-redirect" feature,
  which is one of two methods of handling NXDOMAIN redirection, and is only
  available in certain versions of BIND.  Redirection using zones of type
  "redirect" is not affected by this vulnerability.

  This release fixes an old NULL pointer dereference bug in png_set_text_2()
  discovered and patched by Patrick Keshishian.  The potential "NULL
  dereference" bug has existed in libpng since version 0.71 of June 26, 1995.
  To be vulnerable, an application has to load a text chunk into the png
  structure, then delete all text, then add another text chunk to the same
  png structure, which seems to be an unlikely sequence, but it has happened.

  This is primarily a bugfix release, and also addresses security issues.
  ssh-agent(1): Will now refuse to load PKCS#11 modules from paths outside
    a trusted whitelist.
  sshd(8): When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix-domain
    sockets would be created by sshd(8) with the privileges of 'root'.
  sshd(8): Avoid theoretical leak of host private key material to
    privilege-separated child processes via realloc().
  sshd(8): The shared memory manager used by pre-authentication compression
    support had a bounds checks that could be elided by some optimising
    compilers to potentially allow attacks against the privileged monitor.
    process from the sandboxed privilege-separation process.
  sshd(8): Validate address ranges for AllowUser and DenyUsers directives at
    configuration load time and refuse to accept invalid ones.  It was
    previously possible to specify invalid CIDR address ranges
    (e.g. user@127.1.2.3/55) and these would always match, possibly resulting
    in granting access where it was not intended.

  from unprivileged processes.
  Thanks to Philip Pettersson for discovering the bug and providing a patch.
  Be sure to upgrade your initrd after upgrading the kernel packages.
  If you use lilo to boot your machine, be sure lilo.conf points to the correct
  kernel and initrd and run lilo as root to update the bootloader.
  If you use elilo to boot your machine, you should run eliloconfig to copy the
  kernel and initrd to the EFI System Partition.

  This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability.  A defect in BIND's
  handling of responses containing a DNAME answer can cause a resolver to exit
  after encountering an assertion failure in db.c or resolver.c.  A server
  encountering either of these error conditions will stop, resulting in denial
  of service to clients.  The risk to authoritative servers is minimal;
  recursive servers are chiefly at risk.

  This kernel fixes a security issue known as "Dirty COW".  A race
  condition was found in the way the Linux kernel's memory subsystem
  handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only
  memory mappings.  An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to
  gain write access to otherwise read-only memory mappings and thus
  increase their privileges on the system.

  This is primarily a bugfix release, and also addresses security issues.
  sshd(8): Mitigate a potential denial-of-service attack against the system's
  crypt(3) function via sshd(8).
  sshd(8): Mitigate timing differences in password authentication that could
  be used to discern valid from invalid account names when long passwords were
  sent and particular password hashing algorithms are in use on the server.
  ssh(1), sshd(8): Fix observable timing weakness in the CBC padding oracle
  countermeasures.
  ssh(1), sshd(8): Improve operation ordering of MAC verification for
  Encrypt-then-MAC (EtM) mode transport MAC algorithms to verify the MAC
  before decrypting any ciphertext.
  sshd(8): (portable only) Ignore PAM environment vars when UseLogin=yes.

  Changes to pkgtool:
  Remove option to install from floppy disks.
  Don't use the --file option, which appears to be broken in the latest version
  of dialog.  The only reason --file was ever used in the first place was to
  work around the Linux ARG_MAX limit of 131072 bytes, and since Linux 2.6.23 a
  much larger limit is in place making it unlikely to become an issue again.
  So we'll go back to passing the package list on the command line.
  Thanks to David Miller for the bug report.

n/samba-4.4.5-i586-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This release fixes a security issue:
  Client side SMB2/3 required signing can be downgraded.
  It's possible for an attacker to downgrade the required signing for an
  SMB2/3 client connection, by injecting the SMB2_SESSION_FLAG_IS_GUEST or
  SMB2_SESSION_FLAG_IS_NULL flags.  This means that the attacker can
  impersonate a server being connected to by Samba, and return malicious
  results.

Slackware 14.2 x86 stable is released!

The long development cycle (the Linux community has lately been living in
"interesting times", as they say) is finally behind us, and we're proud to
announce the release of Slackware 14.2.  The new release brings many updates
and modern tools, has switched from udev to eudev (no systemd), and adds
well over a hundred new packages to the system.  Thanks to the team, the
upstream developers, the dedicated Slackware community, and everyone else
who pitched in to help make this release a reality.

The ISOs are off to be replicated, a 6 CD-ROM 32-bit set and a dual-sided
32-bit/64-bit x86/x86_64 DVD.  Please consider supporting the Slackware
project by picking up a copy from store.slackware.com.  We're taking
pre-orders now, and offer a discount if you sign up for a subscription.

Have fun!  :-)
