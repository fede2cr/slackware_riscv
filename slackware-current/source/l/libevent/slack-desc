# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libevent: libevent (event loop library)
libevent:
libevent: libevent is meant to replace the event loop found in event driven
libevent: network servers. An application just needs to call event_dispatch()
libevent: and then add or remove events dynamically without having to change the
libevent: event loop. The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a
libevent: callback function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or
libevent: after a timeout has been reached.
