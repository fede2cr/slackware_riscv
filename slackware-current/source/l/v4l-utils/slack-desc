# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

v4l-utils: v4l-utils (libraries and utilities for video4linux)
v4l-utils:
v4l-utils: libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction
v4l-utils: layer on top of video4linux2 devices. The purpose of this (thin)
v4l-utils: layer is to make it easy for application writers to support a wide
v4l-utils: variety of devices without having to write separate code for
v4l-utils: different devices in the same class. Linux V4L2 and DVB API
v4l-utils: utilities are also included.
