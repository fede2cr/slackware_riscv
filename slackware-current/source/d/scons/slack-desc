# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

scons: is implemented in Python, and its "configuration files" are actually
scons: Python scripts, allowing you to use the full power of a real
scons: scripting language to solve build problems. You do not, however, need
scons: to know Python to use SCons effectively.
