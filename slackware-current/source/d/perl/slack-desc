# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

perl: perl (Practical Extraction and Report Language)
perl:
perl: Larry Wall's "Practical Extraction and Report Language". Perl is a
perl: language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files, extracting
perl: information from those text files, and printing reports based on that
perl: information. It's also a good language for many system management
perl: tasks. The language is intended to be practical (easy to use,
perl: efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal).
