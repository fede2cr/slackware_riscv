# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

elilo: elilo (Linux Loader for EFI-based platforms)
elilo:
elilo: This is elilo, a boot loader originally developed by HP for IA-64
elilo: systems. This is used to load the kernel and initial ramdisk on
elilo: machines that use UEFI. Since most UEFI implementations are 64-bit,
elilo: the 64-bit EFI binary is generally the one to use (even for loading
elilo: a 32-bit kernel).
