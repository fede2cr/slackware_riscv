# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

lilo: lilo (Linux Loader)
lilo:
lilo: Generic Boot Loader for Linux ('LInux LOader') by Werner Almesberger.
lilo: LILO boots Linux from your hard drive. It can also boot other
lilo: operating systems such as Windows and OS X, and can even boot DOS from
lilo: the second hard drive. LILO comes with utilities and documentation
lilo: that make it easier to install, such as 'liloconfig' and 'QuickStart'.
lilo: NOTE: Installing boot loaders is inherently dangerous. Be sure to have
lilo: some means to boot your system from a different media if you install
lilo: LILO on your hard disk.
