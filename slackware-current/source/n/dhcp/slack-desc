# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

dhcp: dhcp (DHCP server and client utilities)
dhcp:
dhcp: This package provides the ISC's DHCP utilities, including both a
dhcp: server and client. The DHCP protocol allows a host to contact a
dhcp: central server which maintains a list of IP addresses which may be
dhcp: assigned on one or more subnets.  A DHCP client may request an
dhcp: address from this pool, and then use it temporarily for communication
dhcp: on the network.  The DHCP protocol also provides a mechanism whereby
dhcp: a client can learn important details about the network to which it is
dhcp: attached, such as the location of a default router or name server.
