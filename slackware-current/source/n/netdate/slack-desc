# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

netdate: set. Protocol names (either udp or tcp) may be interspersed with the
netdate: host names, and determine the protocol which will be used to connect
netdate: to the hosts whose names follow, up to the next protocol name or the
netdate: end of the arguments. The default protocol is udp.

netdate: These days, "ntpdate" is probably a better choice.
