# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

tcp_wrappers: daemons in /etc/inetd.conf use tcp_wrappers' tcpd wrapper daemon.
tcp_wrappers: If you plan to do much networking, you will need tcp_wrappers.
