# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

netkit-rusers: responding to the rusers query, the hostname with the names of the
netkit-rusers: users currently logged on is printed on each line. The rusers
netkit-rusers: command will wait for one minute to catch late responders.

netkit-rusers: networks.
