# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

pidentd: pidentd (TCP/IP IDENT protocol server)
pidentd:
pidentd: The identd daemon implements the IDENT protocol as specified in
pidentd: RFC1413. When your machine connects to a remote system, the remote
pidentd: machine may connect to your identd daemon to find out either the
pidentd: user name or other information about the process that initiated
pidentd: the connection. Some remote machines may choose not to allow your
pidentd: connections if you do not provide access to an identd daemon.
