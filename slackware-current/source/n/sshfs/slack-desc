# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

sshfs: sshfs (SSH filesystem client)
sshfs:
sshfs: This is a filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer Protocol.
sshfs: Since most SSH servers already support this protocol it is very easy
sshfs: to set up: i.e. on the server side there's nothing to do. On the
sshfs: client side mounting the filesystem is as easy as logging into the
sshfs: server with ssh.
