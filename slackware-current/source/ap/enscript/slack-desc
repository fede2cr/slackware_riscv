# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

enscript: Enscript converts text files to PostScript and spools the generated
enscript: output to a printer or saves it to a file. If no input files are

enscript: printouts.
