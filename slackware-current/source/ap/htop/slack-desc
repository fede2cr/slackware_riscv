# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

htop:
htop: htop is a free (GPL) ncurses-based process viewer that is similar to
htop: the well-known "top" program, but allows to scroll the list vertically
htop: and horizontally to see all processes and their full command lines.

htop: entering their PIDs.
