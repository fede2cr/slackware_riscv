# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

seejpeg: Seejpeg is an image viewer which uses SVGAlib. In spite of the name,
seejpeg: it understands the JPEG, GIF, PPM, BMP and TARGA formats. One nice
seejpeg: feature of seejpeg is that it automatically decides on the best video
seejpeg: mode to use based on the image being displayed and the video card
seejpeg: being used.
